Before running setup script make sure you have xcode installed by running this command.
`xcode-select --install`

## Stuff I use
- Helix Text Editor
  I use helix because it has built-in lsp support all you need is the lsp
  binary for the language you'll be using and your good to go, no need to
  configure the lsp settings unless you want to customize it some more,
  also built-in tree-sitter, file picker, and the movement and text editing is just so intuitive.
